Scholars have long been focussed on studying lobbying and potential influence that such activities can have on public policy. The ability to lobby state actors, however, critically depends on having access to them in the first place. So far much of the theoretical and empirical literature on potential mechanisms of acquiring access has been limited to donations or other forms of financial transactions. In this study I argue that in pluralist states with campaign spending limits, the influence of money is more restricted and other mechanisms such as economic importance, long period of state-government interactions and ideological proximity play an important role in meeting government officials. I use government transparency reports for 2010-2017 from the ministerial departments in the UK to measure the level of access and saliency of policy issues that provide evidence of the importance of these alternative mechanisms.

##### "Gender, Justice and Deliberation: Women’s Voice in Post-Conflict Reconciliation", *R&R*

We study women's speaking behavior to find out why women's presence in debates about post-conflict justice does not result in gender-responsive outcomes. To explain women's presence without influence, we investigate whether processes behind those outcomes are themselves gendered. We apply multi-method text analysis to an original corpus of over half a million words in six languages from civil society debates in the Balkans. These debates preceded the adoption of the Statute of the Regional Fact-finding Commission that did not reflect women's needs and concerns. Our analysis shows that male dominance at the micro-level of turn-taking and the absence of topics addressing gender-specific experience of conflict can drive gender-insensitive outcome, rather than commonly assumed indicators of gender inequality such as women's representation, including the frequency, length and the deliberative quality of their speech. This study contributes novel insights to why gender-just peace is elusive despite women's increased participation in peace-making.

##### "Independent Media in Electoral Autocracies"

A large literature recognizes growing threats to press freedom in electoral autocracies. However, few studies test how independent media under strain adjust coverage. We propose that outlets’ response to state pressure evolves endogenously based on their revenue mix and incentives to pander. We test this argument with evidence from contemporary Russia. Using a corpus of 85,000 news items, we investigate how the abrupt removal of independent outlet TV Rain from television providers influenced its coverage, and content similarity with state outlet Channel 1. We find that shortly after TV Rain was disconnected from providers, its tone of government coverage improved, and that the similarity of its content with state outlets increased. Overtime, however, TV Rain became more critical. Findings, which speak to scholarship on authoritarian endurance, highlight a tradeoff in autocrats’ use of intimidation. While attacks on free press may have short-term benefits, they could backfire over the longer run.

##### "Parliament in Crisis: Power of Representative Assemblies in XVII century"

In the standard explanation for the rise of legislative assemblies rulers lacking resources were forced to bargain with other societal actors, who demanded rights and representation before conceding financial support. Most previous works have focused on the bargaining process between these earlier assemblies and the monarch largely ignoring the behaviour of legislative actors during this process. We contend that elites in early representative assemblies used these power struggles to set the political agenda and signal their desire for sovereignty over the realm. We empirically examine this mechanism on the XVII century England, using the activity reported in the Journals of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, two of the longest established representative assemblies in the world. In order to measure the power of both representative assemblies, we implement a novel strategy based on entropy of topic shares in daily records of parliamentary activity. We show that elites in both representative assemblies strategically used power voids to signal their attention to a wider set of topics. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of early and contemporary legislative assemblies and provide a new way of measuring institutional power through the analysis of text.

##### "Record Linkage with Text: Merging Data Sets When Information is Limited"

The recent years have seen the emergence of new, more scalable ways to link information about individuals across multiple data sources. However, merging data sets when the number of variables used for record linkage is restricted remains challenging. In this paper I consider the case when the information is limited to a single multi-token text string. This situation often occurs when researchers work with organisation names, user accounts or any other short labels. In this paper I run a simulation study showing the limitations of the existing approaches that under-perform due to a lack of standardisation and short length of text. Despite these caveats, some information, such as probability of encountering different words remains unexploited by the currently available methods. I propose an alternative approach, where the constituent tokens are weighted by their overall language frequencies. This method is applied to simulated data, as well as large number of government transparency reports from the UK. The proposed weighting method offers a more robust and scalable approach both to deduplicating the transparency reports and linking them to organisation-level covariates.

##### "Path to Fake: Who Goes and How Did They Get There?"

Dubious websites advancing so called 'fake-news' have received a lot of attention, especially in the electoral context. While much of the research has been focused on their pervasiveness and prevalence in voters' media diets, we know less about the people who are prone to consume misleading information online and how they reach the websites that spread it. To answer these questions we combine a nationally representative two-wave panel collected during the 2018 United States Legislative elections with detailed information on the web-tracking activity of respondents for 2 months prior to the elections. Using the full web-browsing history we show that older respondents are more likely to visit unreliable news websites. We also find that users are more likely to go to unreliable media from Facebook, Twitter and email subscriptions than to credible sources, while search engines are more likely to lead to trustworthy news websites.

##### "Emotion Shift and Transitional Justice in the Balkans"

While emotions are central to recovery of post-conflict societies, we only have limited understanding of the role of emotions in transitional justice processes. Although it has been argued that post-conflict transitional justice needs to bring about a shift of negative to positive emotions to promote inter-ethnic reconciliation, we lack empirical evidence of emotion shift over time. To address this gap, we study a five-year-long multi-ethnic justice-seeking process. We focus on communication involving former adversaries, whilst drawing on theories of agonistic deliberation in divided societies, which foreground emotions and conflict in politics, and accounting for varying levels of exposure to violence. The study applies quantitative text analysis to a corpus of 1 million words of multi-lingual transcripts of transitional justice debates in the Balkans, in combination with a six-country survey of some 6,000 respondents. Instead of an emotion shift, we find that emotions remain stable over time, and identify prevalence of positive over negative emotions. At the micro level, dyads of speakers from ethnic groups involved in direct violence are more anxious, but not angrier or sadder, and more embedded in the transitional justice process. At the macro level of broader societies, we find that awareness of transitional justice debates is positively correlated with compassion. This fine-grained comparative study of emotions furthers the understanding of the affective dimension of transitional justice by providing evidence for a contentious but constructive transitional justice-seeking across ethnic lines without an emotion shift.
