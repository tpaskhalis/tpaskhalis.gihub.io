Scholars have pinpointed that women’s underrepresentation in peace-making results in gendered outcomes that do not address women’s needs and interests. Despite recent increased representation at the negotiating table, women still have a limited influence on peace-making outcomes. We propose that differences in female and male speeches reflected in the gendered patterns in discourse during peace-making explain how women’s influence is curtailed. We examine women’s speaking behavior in transitional justice debates in the post-conflict Balkans. Applying multi-method quantitative text analysis to over half a million words in multiple languages, we analyze structural and thematic speech patterns. We find that men’s domination of turn-taking and the absence of topics reflecting women’s needs and interests lead to a gendered outcome; the sequences of men talking after men are longer than those of women talking after women, which restricts women’s deliberative space and opportunities to develop and sustain arguments that reflect their concerns. We find no evidence that women’s limited influence is driven by lower deliberative quality of their speeches. This study of gendered dynamics at the micro-level of discourse identifies a novel dimension of male domination during peace-making.

Scholars have long been focussed on studying lobbying and potential influence that such activities can have on public policy. The ability to lobby state actors, however, critically depends on having access to them in the first place. So far much of the theoretical and empirical literature on potential mechanisms of acquiring access has been limited to donations or other forms of financial transactions. In this study I argue that in pluralist states with campaign spending limits, the influence of money is more restricted and other mechanisms such as economic importance, long period of state-government interactions and ideological proximity play an important role in meeting government officials. I use government transparency reports for 2010-2017 from the ministerial departments in the UK to measure the level of access and saliency of policy issues that provide evidence of the importance of these alternative mechanisms.

Previous research has sought to explain the emergence and predominance of early representative assemblies over monarchs. Yet, how parliamentarians behaved during the struggles for power remains largely unknown. We contend that parliamentary elites used periods of uncertainty to set the political agenda and show their willingness for sovereignty. We test this claim on seventeenth century England using activities reported in the Journals of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In addition, we implement a novel strategy of measuring institutional power based on entropy of topic shares in daily records of parliamentary activity. Our results show that elites strategically used power voids to expand their attention to a wider set of topics, increase their pressure on the monarch and present themselves as rulers which were ready to govern. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of early and contemporary representative assemblies.

Existing literature recognizes growing threats to press freedom in electoral autocracies. However, few studies investigate how independent media respond to state pressure. We propose that outlets’ response to state pressure is shaped by their sources of revenue and editors’ incentives to pander. We test this argument with evidence from contemporary Russia. Using a corpus of 85,000 news items, we investigate how the abrupt removal of independent outlet TV Rain from television providers influenced its coverage. We find that shortly after TV Rain was disconnected from providers, the tone of its government coverage improved and its content became more similar to that of the leading state channel. Overtime, however, TV Rain became more critical. Our findings, which speak to scholarship on authoritarian endurance, highlight a tradeoff in autocrats’ use of intimidation. While attacks on free press may have short-term benefits, they could ultimately backfire.

##### "The Limited Influence of Russian Trolls on Attitudes and Behaviors in the 2016 US Election.", *under review*

There is currently widespread concern that malicious foreign actors are using social media to intervene in the elections of Western democracies to influence the attitudes and behaviors of voters. However, few high-quality data sources exist to investigate the success or failure of these foreign influence campaigns. We use a unique longitudinal survey dataset of US citizens that we linked to their Twitter feeds during the 2016 presidential election campaign to document the effects of exposure to posts from Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) trolls on attitudes and voting behavior. We provide the first direct evidence that exposure to foreign influence campaigns on social media during the 2016 campaign was highly concentrated among an exceptionally small group of users, primarily highly partisan Republicans. A scant 1% of US users accounted for 70% of exposures to Russian troll activity. Furthermore, exposure to foreign influence campaigns was dwarfed - by more than an order of magnitude - by content from domestic political news media and politicians. Using the multi-wave structure of the survey panel data, we test whether exposure to posts from Russian trolls affected political preferences and voting behavior. Across a wide array of outcomes, we find no demonstrable effects of exposure to troll activity on changes in political attitudes, polarization, or voting behavior during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the limitations of foreign influence campaigns on social media that have sought to directly intervene in the democratic elections of their adversaries.

##### "Record Linkage with Text: Merging Data Sets When Information is Limited"

The recent years have seen the emergence of new, more scalable ways to link information about different entities across multiple data sources. However, merging data sets when the number of variables used for record linkage is restricted remains challenging. In this paper I consider the case when the information is limited to a single multi-token text string. This situation often occurs when researchers work with organization names, user accounts or any other short labels. Using Lobbying Disclosure Act data I illustrate substantive implications that the choice of record linkage approach can have in empirical research. I review the existing approaches and consider three types of noise that can typically be encountered in this scenario: character-level, word-level or a combination of both. Furthermore, I conduct a simulation study showing the sensitivity of the existing approaches to the presence of errors occurring at different levels. The results suggest that the optimal choice of a record linkage approach depends on contextual knowledge about the most likely type of noise, as well as stress the need to conduct sensitivity analysis using different record linkage approaches.

Dubious websites advancing so called 'fake-news' have received a lot of attention, especially in the electoral context. While much of the research has been focused on their pervasiveness and prevalence in voters' media diets, we know less about the people who are prone to consume misleading information online and how they reach the websites that spread it. To answer these questions we combine a nationally representative two-wave panel collected during the 2018 United States Legislative elections with detailed information on the web-tracking activity of respondents for 2 months prior to the elections. Using the full web-browsing history we show that older respondents are more likely to visit unreliable news websites. We also find that users are more likely to go to unreliable media from Facebook, Twitter and email subscriptions than to credible sources, while search engines are more likely to lead to trustworthy news websites.

##### "Emotion Shift and Transitional Justice in the Balkans"

While emotions are central to recovery of post-conflict societies, we only have limited understanding of the role of emotions in transitional justice processes. Although it has been argued that post-conflict transitional justice needs to bring about a shift of negative to positive emotions to promote inter-ethnic reconciliation, we lack empirical evidence of emotion shift over time. To address this gap, we study a five-year-long multi-ethnic justice-seeking process. We focus on communication involving former adversaries, whilst drawing on theories of agonistic deliberation in divided societies, which foreground emotions and conflict in politics, and accounting for varying levels of exposure to violence. The study applies quantitative text analysis to a corpus of 1 million words of multi-lingual transcripts of transitional justice debates in the Balkans, in combination with a six-country survey of some 6,000 respondents. Instead of an emotion shift, we find that emotions remain stable over time, and identify prevalence of positive over negative emotions. At the micro level, dyads of speakers from ethnic groups involved in direct violence are more anxious, but not angrier or sadder, and more embedded in the transitional justice process. At the macro level of broader societies, we find that awareness of transitional justice debates is positively correlated with compassion. This fine-grained comparative study of emotions furthers the understanding of the affective dimension of transitional justice by providing evidence for a contentious but constructive transitional justice-seeking across ethnic lines without an emotion shift.
