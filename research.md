New technologies provide scholars and practitioners with challenges and opportunities. On one
hand, there is ‘too much’ data, mostly, but not exclusively in digital archives and social media,
and new ethical concerns, around data sharing, use and attribution. On the other hand, new
datasets provide opportunities to address the problem of ‘too little’ evidence, and technology
can help us to process and analyze even the largest datasets relatively efficiently, using
innovative methods. In this paper, we consider these opportunities and challenges from the
perspective of transitional justice, interrogating the various ways in which technology can help
operationalize data and drive the research agenda forward. We consider a range of new data
technologies – digital archives, visual images, transcripts, social media (Facebook) and analytic
software – which make possible novel ways of thinking, and the potential for new questions and
insights, grounding theory in knowledge generated by transitional justice processes themselves.

### *Gender, Justice and Deliberation: Women’s Voice in Post-Conflict Reconciliation*
Denisa Kostovicova, **Tom Paskhalis**

Scholars and practitioners have criticised women’s marginalisation in post-conflict peace-building,
including justice-seeking. This criticism has resulted in greater representation of women in these processes,
but has not always translated into gender-sensitive policies and practice. Most studies have focussed on
the effects of participation, rather than participation itself. We address this gap in the scholarship on
transitional justice by identifying mechanisms that shed light on the unfulfilled expectations of women’s
participation. In order to examine women’s contribution to the debates about post-conflict justice we
combine quantitative content analysis and quantitative text analysis. We use Discourse Quality Index
(DQI), an instrument that measures normative dimensions of deliberation according to Habermas’ theory
of communicative action. In total, we coded 1,211 speech acts along 8 dimensions of the DQI. Furthermore,
we apply structural topic modelling, a method for discerning topical content in textual data, to an original
corpus of more than half a million words. The corpus was built from the transcripts in six languages and
comprises 20 civil society debates about reconciliation in the Balkans, which took place between 2006
and 2011.

### *The Least Unclear Language: How Avoiding Negatives Produces Positive Understanding*

Most quantitative text analysis approaches rely on ’bag-of-words‘ model, which
ignores word order. This might raise a number of issues if the analysed texts
extensively use negation at the sentence level. In this work we investigate the im-
plications of this simplifying assumption for the analysis of political texts. Drawing
on natural language processing tools, we consider party manifestos in Britain and
Germany. Using grammatical sentence as the unit of analysis, we show that op-
position parties are more prone to frame their campaigns in negative terms than
governing parties. Among opposition we also observe the variation between centrist
and more radical and fringe parties. These results offer tentative support to the
link between negation and negative campaigning in European party systems. We
further compare our results with traditional, dictionary-based approach. Overall,
sentence-level analysis based on automatic, machine-learnt segmentation rules al-
lows both replicable and transparent research design, together with conceptually
easier and linguistically sound interpretation of the results.
