Gender-just peace is elusive despite women’s increased participation in peace-
making. Scholars have focused on the content of peace-agreements and the design
of transitional justice instruments while overlooking how processes behind those
outcomes may themselves be gendered. We study women’s speaking behavior to
find out why women’s presence during justice-seeking does not result in gender-
responsive outcomes. We apply multi-method text analysis to an original corpus of
over half a million words in six languages from civil society debates in the post-
conflict Balkans. These debates preceded the adoption of the Statute of the Re-
gional Fact-Finding Commission that does not reflect women’s needs and concerns.
Our analysis shows that male dominance at the micro-level of turn-taking and
the absence of topics addressing gender-specific experience of conflict drive gender-
insensitive outcome, rather than commonly assumed indicators of gender inequality
such as women’s representation, including the frequency, length and the deliberative
quality of their speech.

### *The Least Unclear Language: How Avoiding Negatives Produces Positive Understanding*

Designing  valid  and  reliable  methods  for  coding  large  quantities  of  text  is
an  inherently  complicated  process.  Manual  coding  of  political  texts  can  be
prone to a range of problems that can lead to unreliable results. In addition
to complex coding schemes, unreliability can result if the coders do not fully
process the sentence when deciding on a code. If this is the case, the cognit-
ive difficulty of processing sentences will influence the reliability of assigned
codes. The current literature on content analysis assumes that coding errors
are uncorrelated with the quantities of interest and are, to a large extent, a
function of the analytical framework. However, this can produce biased estim-
ated if some political actors are more likely to use certain language patterns.
Psycholinguistic theory suggests that sentences with negations are inherently
more difficult to process. By analyzing speeches from the US Congress and
the  UK  House  of  Commons  as  well  as  party  manifestos,  we  show  that  the
number of negated sentences varies considerably over time and in a substant-
ively  meaningful  way.  For  instance,  legislators  from  government  parties  use
fewer negations than their opposition counterparts. We address the question
of whether linguistic features affect human misclassification rates with a re-
analysis of crowd-coded party manifesto sentences and a coding experiment
where we directly randomize the presence of some linguistic features. Our res-
ults show whether coding errors can be tied to specific linguistic features of a
coding unit and thus whether those features have the potential to bias human
coding.
