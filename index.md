I am a PhD student at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk), [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology/), working with [Kenneth Benoit](http://www.kenbenoit.net/) and [Benjamin Lauderdale](http://www.benjaminlauderdale.net/wp/). I have been involved in teaching quantitative research methods and text analysis. 

My research interests lie in political methodology, computational social science, text analysis and data science. More broadly, I am interested in politics, languages, technology, statistics and how those can be put together to address societal challenges.    

Prior to starting my PhD I have spent some time in data science industry. I received my BA (or Specialist, to be more precise) in Political Psychology from the [St Petersburg State University](http://english.spbu.ru/), [Department of Psychology](http://www.psy.spbu.ru/english-version) and my MSc in Social Research Methods from LSE. I also have a diploma in Software Engineering from the [SPbU, Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics](http://www.math.spbu.ru/eng/).
